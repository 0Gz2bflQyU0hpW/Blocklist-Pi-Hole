# Blocklist for Pi-Hole [Amdromeda]
Hi, in this repository you will find my blocklists for Pi-Hole.


All the lists are reviewed and are the most extensive. Analyzed to avoid blocking the necessary domains.

## BlockList details:
| List | Syze | That makes? |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Ad Servers.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amdromeda/Blocklist-Pi-Hole/master/Ad%20Servers.txt) | 45.647 domains | Block Ad Servers |
| [Mining pages.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amdromeda/Blocklist-Pi-Hole/master/Mining%20pages.txt) | 35.382 domains | Block all mining pages |
| [Xiaomi, Mi-Fit and Amazfit.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Amdromeda/Blocklist-Pi-Hole/master/Xiaomi%2C%20Mi-Fit%20and%20Amazfit.txt) | 941 domains | Block all Xiaomi apps, Mi-Fit and Amazfit |

## How to support block lists:
You can support in multiple ways:
 - Submit false positives
 - Submit new (tested) sources
 - Broadcast with other users
 
 ## Note:

The Xiaomi lists block all traffic except updates, if you want to log in I advise you to temporarily disable it.
