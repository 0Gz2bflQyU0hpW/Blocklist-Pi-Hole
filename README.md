# Amdromeda blocklist for Pi-hole
Hi, in this repository you will find my blocklists for Pi-Hole (They can be used in some other services)

# Why these DNS lists
This project aims to unify the DNS blocklists by adding my contributions, keeping the lists error free and optimized. I believe in privacy and I think it is necessary to have lists that block certain addresses.

Here you will find the most extensive and cleanest lists. I invite you to help me in this task.

## BlockList details
| LIST NAME | DESCRIPTION | ENTRIES (domains) | RAW / TXT |
|:---------:|:-------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
Ads servers | - | 0 | [list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) | 
Mining pages | - | 0 | [list](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) |
