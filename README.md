# Amdr0meda Blocklist Pi-Hole
Hi, in this repository you will find my blocklists for Pi-Hole (They can be used in some other services)

# Why these DNS lists / Porque estas listas DNS
This project aims to unify the DNS blocklists by adding my contributions, keeping the lists error free and optimized. I believe in privacy and I think it is necessary to have lists that block certain addresses.

Here you will find the most extensive and cleanest lists. I invite you to help me in this task.
